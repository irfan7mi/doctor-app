🏥 Apollo247 Clone – General Physician Listing Page
📌 Project Description
This project is a clone of Apollo247’s General Physician page. It showcases a doctor listing interface built with modern technologies. The aim is to demonstrate server-side filtering, REST API integration, and Off-page SEO capabilities using Next.js.

Users can view doctors based on filters like Specialty and City. Data is fetched from a backend API connected to a SQL database. This assignment demonstrates building a single destination page with server-rendered metadata and functional filtering.
